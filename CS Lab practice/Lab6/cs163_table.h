//In Lab #4 we will be working with the journal class from Lab #2 and 3. In this lab we will
//extend it by creating a hash table of journals. The data structure will be an array
//of head pointers to linear linked lists of nodes. Each node has a single journal entry

struct node
{
       journal_entry entry; //just one journal entry
       node * next;
};

//Now let's create a table ADT. A table ADT works by the value of the data
//instead of the position of where it is located. It allows us the class designers
//to begin using non-linear data structures!
